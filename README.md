<h1 style="text-align:center">Hi, I'm Vincent</h1>
I'm an IT student in Italy, but I'm trying to expand my knowledge to become a front-end developer. Currently learning JS and open to collaborating in any sort of project.

## My Knowledge
I'm a young front-end developer still learning, I try to make the best out of my knowledge and free time so my solutions are always centered toward being both easy to realize and easy to read. I like to work in a group over than working alone and feel like I'm proficient at expressing my ideas to others.
My stack is made of:

- ðŸ“ƒ HTML
- ðŸŸª CSS & Bootstrap 5
- ðŸŸ¨ JavaScript
- ðŸ”µ C++
- â˜• Java

I'm currently getting down the basics of:

- Python
- C#
- NodeJS
- ReactJS

## About Me

Interested in math, but more in logical thinking than everything else since I was a little kid, I got into computers at about 10 with my first laptop, after some years of tinkering with hardware and learning tricks to make better use of the PC, I started to pick up coding as a hobby at around 14. 

I've had experience in contributing to the development of videogames through RPG Maker and made some basic websites for people I know.

I really like to learn new things and find in the front-end a good way to express my ideas: creating interesting and functional websites is a passion for me first and foremost.

As a developer, I try to optimize my coding time and realize intuitive solutions to problems that I can use in various contexts.
